> Given a string `s` consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return `'_'`.

#### Example

- For `s = "abacabad"`, the output should be `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'`
  - There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.
- For `s = "abacabaabacaba"`, the output should be `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'`
  - There are no characters in this string that do not repeat
