# Find First Duplicate (Arrays)

## CodeSignal

### Question Description. [Link](https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/pMvymcahZ8dY4g75q/description)

> Given an array `a` that contains only numbers in the range from `1` to `a.length`, find the first duplicate **number** for which the second occurrence has the minimal index.
> In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the **number** for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return `-1`.

#### Example

- For `a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]`, the output should be `firstDuplicate(a) = 3`.

  - There are `2` duplicates: numbers `2` and `3`.
  - The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of `2` does, so the answer is `3`.

- For `a = [2, 2]`, the output should be `firstDuplicate(a) = 2`.

- For `a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1]`, the output should be `firstDuplicate(a) = -1`.
