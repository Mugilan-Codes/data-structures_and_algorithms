# Graph Data Structures

## Notes

- `Graph = Nodes(or Vertex) + Edges`

- Two Types
  - Directed
  - Un-Directed

- Traversal types
  - Depth First (uses Stack)
  - Breadth First (uses Queue)

- A Graph can be
  - Cyclic (creates infinite loop on traversal)
  - Acyclic (no cycles)

### Implementation

- DFS & BFS ([Java](Traversal.java), [JavaScript](traversal.js))
- Has Path ([Java](HasPath.java), [JavaScript](hasPath.js))
- Undirected Path in Un-Directed Graph ([JavaScript](undirectedPath.js))
