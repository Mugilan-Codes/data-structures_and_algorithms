> how to define and implement algorithm?

- The steps in the algorithm needs to be in a very specific order
- The steps also needs to be distinct
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time

## Big O (Upper Bounds of an algorithm)

> It is the theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.
>
> O(n) is an example of the notaion

- `O` is the `Order of magnitude of complexity`
- `(n)` is `A function of the size`

> Polynomial Runtimes (Best to Worst)

- `O(1)` - Constant Time
- `O(log n)` _(or)_ `O(ln n)` - Logarithmic (or) Sublinear Runtime
- `O(n)` - Linear Time
- `O(n log n)` - Quasi-Linear Runtime
- `O(n^2)` - Quadratic Runtime
- `O(n^3)` - Cubic Runtime

> Brute force algorithm have a worst case of Exponential Runtime (_**`O(x^n)`**_)
>
> Travelling Salesman have a worst case of Factorial/Combinatorial Runtime (_**`O(n!)`**_)
